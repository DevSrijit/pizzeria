    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Established in 1990 by the passionate Chef Giovanni, our Pizzeria has grown from a small, humble eatery to a cherished local gem. Giovanni's dream was to bring the true taste of Italy to our community, and over the decades, we've stayed true to that vision. Our journey has been one of dedication to authentic Italian cuisine, and we've become a beloved institution known not only for our delectable pizzas but also for our warm, friendly service. Being a part of this community means the world to us, and we're excited to continue serving our neighbors for many more years to come.</p>
